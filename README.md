# true_random
To obtain completely unanticipated value, True Random module.

## What is pseudo random?
>To be frank there is nothing generated in the computer machines are truely random.
They are just *__Pseudo random__*.

## Pseudo random
A sequence of numbers that seems statistically random but was really generated by a fully deterministic and repeatable process is known as a pseudorandom sequence.

Pseudorandom sequence methods are different but at some point the sequence will repeat or predictable. 

So, How to get true randome, Confused ? :confused:

## What about *__true_random__* ?
This package uses different approach. Instead of using the std algo. It uses multitple entropies to get randomized. 

>A entropies can't be predictable since it's not gererated by an algo.

## Entropies
1. CPU usage
2. Power consumption
3. Memory usage and allocation
4. Machine temperatures
5. Network strength and speed
6. Mouse coordinates points
7. Key stokes

## Conclusion
The package uses these entropies to get randomized. The no of entropies can be determine by the random level on th package. For now we use more native packages to minimize the dependecy.
